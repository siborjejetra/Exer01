	<h1> Jetra Mae S. Sibor </h1>
	<h2> Jet </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 130 because binary numbers is not that confusing unlike programming subjects. </li>
    <li> Ethics is my favorite GE so far, the professor is cool, the topics are eye-opening, my classmates are fun, what's there not to like? </li>
    <li> To be honest, I don't even like programming but for the sake of this qustion, I think Python is the easiest.</li> 
    <li> There's nothing special happenings during my semestral break. Most days were spent laying on my bed, just there freeing myself from stress.</li> 
    <li> When Taal volcano erupted, I was already here at LB. I live in Calamba and I kinda want to stay away from there because there's no electricity and water supply. I just spent those days locked in our apartment.</li>
